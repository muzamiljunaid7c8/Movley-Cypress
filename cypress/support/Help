DataTable
If you want to avoid the hardcode, I recommend you to review this, and change the code in this way:

Scenario: Filling the form to shop
  Given I open ECommerce Page
  When I fill the form details
    | name   | bobz |
    | gender | Male |
  Then validate the forms behaviour
  And select the Shop Page 
The step implementation:

When('I fill the form details',function(dataTable){
  const formVals = datatable.rowsHash();
  homePage.getEditBox().type(formVals.name);
  homePage.getGender().select(formVals.gender);
});
And if you want to repeat the same scenario with different data:

Scenario Outline: Filling the form to shop
  Given I open ECommerce Page
  When I fill the form details
    | name   | <exampleName>   |
    | gender | <exampleGender> |
  Then validate the forms behaviour
  And select the Shop Page 
  
  Examples:
    | exampleName | exampleGender |
    | bobz        | Male          |
    | Jane        | Female        |
This scenario will execute twice, one execution with the data bobz Male, and another one with Jane Female
